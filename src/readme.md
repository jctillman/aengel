## Interesting history of classes

It's difficult to class what you're doing at any moment into a category, such that in a moment you can identify what you are doing unambiguously in one category.

1. Happpy with what doing? (Yes, No)
2. Why are you doing what you are doing? (Work, Personal Project, Waste)
3. What are you doing (Programming, Communicating, Reading Long Form, Social Media, Watching Something)

But this didn't work. First, I had a lot of difficulty distinguishing between waste and personal projects, when the personal project involved research. And second, the third item just felt like it kept getting longer.

So replaced with.

1. "Is what is on the screen matching current highest self?" (Yes, No)
2. "For what reason is what is on the screen on it?" (Work, Personal, Explore, Waste, Other)
